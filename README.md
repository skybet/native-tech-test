# SkyBet iOS/Android Tech Test

# **Scenario**

You have been asked to create a new app. The app should be capable of displaying information about multiple horse races. A user should be able to select a race to get more detailed information about the horses within the race including the horses odds. They should be able to tap on the odds and this should open the horse racing page on the SkyBet website within the app. 

How you implement the UI is up to you, we wonâ€™t be testing your design skills e.g App Icons or Images etc. 

The product owner has given you some free reign to implement features that you think the user might be interested in having. This could include securing the app using TouchID(iOS)/Fingerprint(Android), FaceID or Animations, etc. Note that you may be asked to explain why you have implemented some features.

## **Additional Requirements**

1. Users should be able to sort the horses by cloth number, by odds, by form. 
2. The data should be stubbed or sit on a remote server. 
- The JSON file provided shows an example of one race. You may create your own or edit this as you see fit.
3. There should be at least 10 races.

## **Expectations**

1. We value well structured, modular, reusable code with maintainable unit tests.
2. You should not use code generation tools.
3. We expect you to use source control.
4. You can write in the following languages:
- iOS: Objective-C / Swift (A note on our UI preferences: whilst we are investigating SwiftUI, we rely heavily on UIKit day to day. If you've not done this before, don't worry - we'll help you learn)
- Android: Java / Kotlin

## **What to submit**

- A bundled/archived repository showing your commit history, for example:
    git bundle create <yourname>.bundle --all --branches
- A covering note explaining the technology choices you have made.
  
## **Equality & Diversity**

We consider all candidates equally, fairly and without bias. To that end, we ask that you do not leave any personally identifying information in your submission (such as your name within an author field or file, or in use as test data).
